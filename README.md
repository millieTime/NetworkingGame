# NetworkingGame
I want to learn about networking, so I'm going to build a game where two players can interact over a network.

Useful websites:
https://pythontic.com/modules/socket/udp-client-server-example
^ Used for the example client and example server in python.


Completed:
Set up a server and a client
Send information back and forth

To Do:
I'd like to abstract the waiting-on-server into a thread so I can just check what the most recent input is. In this game, current positions will be what matter, not what happened to get them there.
